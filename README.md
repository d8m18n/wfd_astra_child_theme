# WebFoundations â€” Astra child theme
This child theme is a somewhat more comprehensive chid theme setup than the basic one provided with the Astra theme, it is used as a basis for new websites built on the Astra theme, and using the Gutenberg editor, no page builders.

It is a work in progress, we're constantly evolving it as and when required.

## Use case
The premise behind the use case for the child theme is as follows;
* The site is being built using the Gutenberg editor, no page builders ( Beaver Builder or Elementor etc. ).
* Any styles or settings that can be changed in the Astra Theme customiser should be changed there.
* Any styles or settings that can be changed in blocks, should be changed in blocks.
